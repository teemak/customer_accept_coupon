Upon analyzing the data of individuals who accepted coupons, it became evident that five specific columns played a significant role in influencing a driver's decision to accept a coupon. The data revealed a predominant trend among young, working-class individuals. Notably, the most critical factor was the destination. In cases where drivers did not have any urgent destination, they comprised 31% of those who accepted coupons. Additionally, the destination appeared to be closely related to the time of day. The post-work hours of 6 pm and 10 pm emerged as the two peak times when drivers were most likely to accept coupons. Furthermore, the age distribution exhibited a pronounced skew towards the younger demographic.

The most frequently redeemed coupons were associated with establishments serving food, such as coffee houses and local dine-in or carry-out restaurants. Moreover, the expiration date of the coupon played a significant role, as coupons with longer validity periods were more likely to be claimed.

Based on this information, it is reasonable to conclude that coupons are more likely to be accepted by young, working individuals who are seeking food options after work, especially when the coupon is set to expire within a day.
